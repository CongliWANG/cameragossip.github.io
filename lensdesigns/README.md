# Lens designs based on Nikon Patents

## Introduction
The Jupyter Notebooks use the [rayopt](https://github.com/quartiq/rayopt) Python library.

See the `data` folder for raw data. The data is copied from the relevant patents, however the lens element
diameters are courtesy Bill Claff. Most patent literature do not provide the diameters of the lens elements,
and therefore these have to be estimated based on the diagrams. 

Sometimes the patent data has an obvious mistake, and sometimes the mistake is not obvious.
We have tried to correct obvious mistakes - these are noted in the data files.
