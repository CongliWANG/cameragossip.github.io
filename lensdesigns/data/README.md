# Raw Design Data

In this folder you will find raw data for lens designs based on patents.

### Data Format

The format of the data is one used by [Bill Claff's OpticalBench tool](http://www.photonstophotos.net/GeneralTopics/Lenses/OpticalBench/OpticalBench.htm).

Following points are worth noting:

* The data file uses TAB as delimiter, so please ensure your editor does not convert TABs to spaces!
* The aspheric data has to be checked against the patent to see if the `k` parameter has had 1.0 deducted from it.

### Caveat

These files are still being worked on and are not yet guaranteed to be accurate!
