        <h2>Nikon F5 and D3 Shared Genes</h2>

        <p>The F5 was a significant technological tour de force from Nikon in 1996. It broke new ground in
            many areas, one of which was speed. A key aspect of the camera’s performance was the reduction
            of mirror bounce, which resulted in decreased blackout time.</p>
        <h3><a name="TOC-Mirror-Dampening-in-F5"></a>Mirror Dampening in F5</h3>
        <p>Nikon F5 was the first SLR from Nikon to use the mirror balancer, which is now standard on all
            high performance Nikon SLRs, including the D3. The best description of the mirror balancer I
            have found was at the Nikon D Technology site, where a flash movie shows how the mirror balancer operates.
            Unforunately the site is no longer available.
        </p>
        <p>The following patent <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US5768644">US 5768644</a> might describe
            the original invention in the F5</p>
        <p>As to how effective the mirror balancer is, this can be seen from a slow motion video of the D3,
            posted recently on Youtube.</p>
        <div>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/o6CFkTCEP5o" frameborder="0"

                allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>Another interesting perspective on the D3 mirror and shutter timing can be obtained from a
            sequence put together by Marianne Oelund, turned into <a href="http://regex.info/blog/2008-09-04/925">a web
                movie by Jeffrey Friedl</a>.</p>
        <p>Here is a slow motion movie of the Nikon F5 mirror/shutter:</p>
        <div>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-upvXx6-enc" frameborder="0"
                allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>The Nikon D4 shutter can be seen in action here:</p>
        <div>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PLxUuTbiU3E" frameborder="0"
                allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>
            Finally a D4 to D4s comparison was posted by Nikon.
        </p>

        </div>
        <h3><a name="TOC-Extremely-Fast-Sequencing"></a>Extremely Fast Sequencing</h3>
        <p>The D3 has a 37 millisecond shutter lag, and 74 millisecond blackout. To achieve this level of
            speed must take extremely high precision and performance. Information regarding the D3
            sequencing is not available, but we can learn something from its ancestor, the F5.</p>
        <p>Here is a page from the F5 repair manual, which depicts the camera’s sequencing.</p>
        <div style="display:block;text-align:left"><a
                href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_gvl_tKpvvNw/S4rzAhxfJBI/AAAAAAAABEQ/fuRAzFl5vcU/s1600/f5-timechart.png"
                imageanchor="1"><img border="0"
                    src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_gvl_tKpvvNw/S4rzAhxfJBI/AAAAAAAABEQ/fuRAzFl5vcU/s1600/f5-timechart.png" /></a>
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>From above, we can see that the F5 shutter lag is about 40 milliseconds. The time it takes for
            the shutter curtains to travel is 2.9 milliseconds. I am not quite sure how the viewfinder
            blackout time is calculated, but it seems that if we count from the time of release, then the
            mirror is down and stable in about 93 milliseconds, though it another 10 milliseconds for it to
            be completely stable. Interestingly, metering starts earlier, but focus detection can only start
            when the mirror is completely stable. Perhaps this explains why Canon’s attempt to get AF
            working at 10 fps is proving to be a challenge.</p>
        <p>I think that the following patent <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US5842065">US 5842065</a> may be
            related to the F5 as well:</p>


        <h3><a name="TOC-Improvements-in-Nikon-D4"></a>Improvements in Nikon D4</h3>
        <div>Nikon's literature on D4 is reticent about changes if any to the mirror balancer used. However
            since the maximum speed has been upped to 10 fps it is possible that some optimisations have
            been made. One clue is the US patent <a
                href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20100189428A1">US20100189428</a>
            that discloses a
            mechanism whereby the secondary mirror is stabilised independently of the main mirror. </div>
        <h3><a name="TOC-Shutter-Lag-and-Viewfinder-Blackout-times"></a>Shutter Lag and Viewfinder Blackout
            times</h3>
        <p>The following table shows the shutter lag and viewfinder blackout times of various Nikon SLRs.
            The information for digital SLRs was obtained from Nikon’s published brochures. It is harder to
            get information about film cameras.</p>
